##  brief description of the CD technology 
I'll be using GitHub, AWS CodePipeline and AWS Elastic Beanstalk to create a deployment pipeline for a my website This allows the website to be updated automatically every time I change my code. 

## How I setup and configure my build jobs 
After creating this repository on github with a simple php file saying "Hello World!". 

I. Set Up the Deployment Environment
This environment is where the CodePipeline will deploy my code.
First I created an Elastic Beanstalk PHP application and an Elastic Beanstalk web server environment.
For my environment type, I chose Load Balancing, auto scaling. [1]

 II. Created and Configured AWS CodePipeline
After creating the pipeline and given it a name, I set my source provider - Github and pointed to my repository : https://github.com/UsagiBo/HackernewsProj . I added Jenkins as my build provider and AWS Elastic Beanstalk as deployment provider. I ponted to my application I created earlier. The last step was to create AWS service role which gives me premission to access resources on my account.[2]
